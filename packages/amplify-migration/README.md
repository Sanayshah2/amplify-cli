## Usage

### Codegen

In Gen1 root directory run the following to generate Gen2 code based on Gen1 configuration:

`npx @aws-amplify/migrate to-gen-2 generate-code`

Once this command runs successfully, the Gen1 project is converted to Gen2 with `amplify` directory containing Gen2 code and `.amplify/migration/amplify` containing Gen1 configuration.
